Rubrary is an information system for the library. Here you can view information on specific books and authors from the system. Also, users can reserve these books for borrowing. Administrators can add and edit individual information.

The information system is written in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) and the framework [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org).
